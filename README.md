## Reflection <a name="reflection"></a>
I managed to get through my online lessons early this week so I had some extra time to play around with this project. I started off doing some initial design mockups in Adobe Illustrator and once I settled on a design I started building out the HTML and CSS. 

I wanted to get the HTML and CSS built out first and get things placed on the site so I would have classes, id, and styles already in place for using in the JavaScript. I didn't have any major hangups except when it came to the loading the tasks that are stored in localStorage. I got it figured out though and once the site was completely working I used my extra time to try to make the site responsive. It currently mostly scales down to mobile devices, but still requires some work. I plan on revisiting after the bootcamp to revamp the page.
